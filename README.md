jamming API

Tasks completed:

1. Added all the necessary API endpoints with JWT authentication. Needs a header for bearer token. Sent on user creation and/or login
2. Added docker-compose and dockerfile. Server should start just with "docker-compose up" at localhost:3000
3. Added some sample integration tests for routes and a unit test for helper
4. Data is persisted in mongodb, via mongoose ORM

Tasks to be done:

1. Adding a swagger API documentation
2. increase supertest API tests
3. Joi validation for ensuring the correct body received in post requests
4. A couple of conditions mentioned in the comments in the routes
5. A postman based API test for testing a complete user creation/ jam flow
